## What to do at the start of each day

1. Ensure all cables exept the power cables are plugged in. The mouse, the keyboard and the camera should all be plugged into the USB ports as shown in the picture. The display cable should be plugged into the port closest to the power port as shown in the picture.

2. Power on the device by plugging in the power cable.
3. Open the file `start.sh` on the Desktop.
4. After the browser opens on the homepage of materialconnexions, accept the cookies (you will have to do this only once at startup)
5. Congrats! The camera will now automatically read the codes and cycle between the different web pages.

## What to do at the end of each day
1. Close the browser by moving the cursor to the top of the screen and pressing the X button.
2. Close the window that shows the view of the camera.
3. Close any other opened windows.
4. Select the berry button at the top left, then scroll down to `Shutdown...`, then select `Shutdown` from the menu that pops up.

5. When the display turns off completely you can safely unplug the power cable.

## If something goes wrong
1. Try to close every window on screen and open the `start.sh` file again.
2. If this doesnt solve it:
  - Open the terminal
